# Lab2_AK
Let's create a `Makefile` (don't forget `clean` section) and `CMakeLists.txt` to build our project. The build result will be the following: one library (static or shared) and one executable. After that, we need to generate from the `CMakeLists.txt` file a build script for `Ninja` build system. Finally, after checking the sucesses of project execution, let's push the project to this repository.

# Result
In this labwork we've created a very small project with three source files: one header file and two source files. As the example of project, that we built, we might use the following repository: https://github.com/SergiiPiatakov/calculator.
